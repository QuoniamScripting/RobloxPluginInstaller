This tool is used for moving Roblox plugins with the extensions: .lua, or .rbxmx
to the roblox plugins folder.

This was made for paid roblox plugins or for moving your plugin backup to the
plugins folder.

//HOW TO USE\\
\\----------//
You can simply move your plugin to the folder of the .batch file I made and copy the plugin
NAME and EXTENSION (Either .lua, or .rbxmx)

Now run the .bat file and enter the name and extension of your plugin
E.G: myplugin.lua OR myplugin.rbxmx

Now press enter and it's done!

Enjoy.
